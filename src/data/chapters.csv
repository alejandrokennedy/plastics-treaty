text,"There are two major groups of countries that have each banded together in the UN Plastics Treaty negotiations, who want almost opposite things.",0,0
text,"The first is the <span>High Ambition Coalition (HAC)</span>, a group of 74 countries plus the European Union, that wants a strong plastics treaty. 
This would include a cap on plastic production, elimination of certain chemicals known to harm human health and the environment, and other things.

text,"These countries haven't individually signed onto the HAC. But because they're part of the European Union, and the EU votes as a bloc, they're implicitly aligned with the HAC.",0,0
text,"The second is called the Like-Minded Group (LMG). This group is opposed to a plastic production cap and stricter plastic chemical regulations. 
Exactly what countries make up the LMG is unclear. According to C&EN reporting, the list of countries in the LMG has only appeared in a meeting paper from INC 3 in Nairobi, Kenya. Those 6 countries are shown here. 
But the document listing these countries also says there are other countries in the group that may be shared at a later date. 
The LMG has yet to disclose these potential other countries.

text,"In UN treaties, each country only gets one vote, regardless of the population. 
Because plastic is a commodity item, worth around $524.5 billion USD in 2024, this treaty doesn’t just have high environmental stakes, it also has vast economic ones.
In terms of population, the LMG is not in the minority. And being mostly petrostates, the LMG has high economic power.
So the issue is more complicated than just a majority rule.

text,"However, some think that there is untapped potential for compromise that we haven’t yet explored in plastics treaty negotiations. 
We need to get away from two groups shouting at each other, and move toward two communities understanding each other, UN expert Maria Ivanova says. 
Only then will negotiators walk away with a finished treaty.
